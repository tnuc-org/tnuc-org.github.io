<h1>About</h1>
<a href="/">back to index page</a><br /><br /><br />
<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
Flo -Florian, less preferably- 25 and from Dortmund, Germany.<br />
Studying Computer Science and working PHP and JavaScript development for a company specialised in hotel software.<br />
My taste in music is <a href="http://last.fm/user/Fdo86">okay</a>.
</p><br /><br />

<h2>Tibia</h2>
<p>
<strong>Mavina</strong>, Elder Druid on Eternia and somewhere between level 120 and 140.<br />
Until October '09 anyway, when I finally got it sold after three months and going down to 100&euro;.<br /><br />
I started playing Tibia by the end of March 2003. Got a pally by the name of Evul Anubris (worst name ever and I hate it) 
up to 77, then rooked it by the beginning of 2006 and came back on Mavina, formerly my brother's char, in October. 
It's sad to see how the game has gone to waste over the years but I guess <strike>there's</strike> there was still the certain 
something that <strike>keeps</strike> kept us going after all those years. At least one of CIP's fuckups, vocation balancing 
pt. 2, was good after all and gave my character a meaning after druids had been useless for years - just like low level pallies.
<br /><br />
I mean, I've been part of pretty much every war one way or another, starting from summer 2003 when I didn't even know what a war was,
without ever having had a <strong>decent</strong> char <strong>of my own</strong> until 2007.<br /><br />

Good times were had, but 8.5 was just too much.<br /><br />
In memory of what what I consider old school Tibia,<br />
Hail HBB ^o)
