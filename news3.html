<a href="/tibia__mc.html">8.62 MC</a> and new <a href="/tibia__tibia_clients.html">client</a> up in the Tibia section.<br /><br />
<strong>As for the pvp changes:</strong><br />
From what I picked up there's two new kill types - assist and revenge?<br />
Do they count as unjusts? What exactly are they logged as on the site?<br />
Won't have time tomorrow, but <a href="/contact">email me</a> and I'll have them added to the <a href="http://unjusts.tnuc.org">unjusts tool</a> by Friday.<br /><br />
On another note - <br />
Is TibiaCam.tv still being updated really or is there a new recorder/player these days?<br />
Might as well update the rest of the page some time.

Unjusts Tool verified working again on:<br />
- IE 6-8<br />
- Firefox 3.6.8<br />

and the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Opera.<br /><br />
Now if there's STILL something wrong with it, you know the drill:<br />

Thanks again for the support, by the way.<br />
Good night.

<h1>Unjusts Tool - help me to help you.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Aug 26 2010</p>
<p class="newstxt">
I've been receiving reports of the unjusts tool being wrong the past couple days. 
Did CIP change the way frags are displayed on the website? Have they already implemented assist kills? 
Or are people just too retarded to copypaste? (you'd be surprised how many people have pasted their 
frags into the contact form even)<br /><br />
Doing lots of overtime these days, so I don't exactly have time -or the characters- to investigate. 
<a href="/contact.html">Email me</a> about possible changes or just send your frag lists 
(including war-mode kills preferably) and I'll get it up and running again by tonight. <br /><br />

<strong>Update Aug 27, 12 AM:</strong><br />
Was CIP's fault apparently, everything seems to be working again.<br />
Thanks for all kill logs and info you sent, guys.<br /><br />

<strong>Update Aug 27, 10 AM:</strong><br />
Okay, still not working apparently. Tested on PROPER browsers (not IE) last night and it worked, 
so I figure it's something with the new layout and IE. Will be home around 10 or 11 and have another look.
<br /><br />
If it still doesn't work for you, <a href="/contact.html">email me</a> name and version of your 
browser.

Hopefully, anyway.

<p class="newstxt">
A bit less than 55 days since the launch of WT Lite and we're counting roughly 55,000 (20k unique) chars in 550 projects.<br />
I've raised the 300 characters limit to 500 to make it fit in with all the fives.

8.57 MC up in the <a href="/tibia__mc.html">tibia</a> section.<br />

<p class="mnewsdate">Apr 02 2010</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Fixed the cookie issue with WT Lite, admin panel should be working for everybody now.<br />
You can blame it on Chrome being a superior browser and me not testing properly after pushing it 
onto the live server (because while it wasn't supposed to work AT ALL in the first place, it 
worked in ALL browsers locally and in Chrome/on my Android phone after uploading).

<h1>Wartool Lite.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Mar 28 2010</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Okay, it's done.<br />
Not as fast as planned but work's been keeping me busy all week.<br /><br />
<a href="http://lite.tnuc.org/">Wartool lite</a> is a manageable online list, much like Guildcheck but with indidual characters 
instead of entire guilds. Characters are divided into two customisable categories (i.e. 
Enemy Main and Second Chars, Allies and Enemies or Friends and Hunted People). Use it for war, 
as a guild blackbook or just to extend your in-game VIP list.<br /><br />
Unlike Guildcheck, Wartool Lite caches character level and vocation of online characters 
and recalls them when the character is offline. Quite a step up from the other scripts on the site, 
but a fucking joke compared to our Wartool 2.0, which would keep chars up to date automatically, logs deaths, logins  
and online times and have a phone list, user groups, character status groups, access quests, and whatnot.<br /><br />
Sucks I won't ever have the time/motivation to fix and share it, but there wouldn't be much of 
a gain either seeing I quit long ago, I'd have to update servers to host it myself, and I 
don't even have ads on the site.<br /><br />
But yeh, why don't you just go take a look?
