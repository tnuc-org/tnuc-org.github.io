<strong>The way to Beregar</strong><br />
-Find NPC Maris at the docks in the Foreign Quarter.<br />

-Find your way through a place OT'er than OTs.<br />
-Go down once more until you see Dwarven NPCs (near goblins).<br />
-Go up the other stairs and activate the ore wagon. Will save you the walk in the future.<br />
-Speak to the NPCs on the main floor and accept their missions.<br /><br /><br />

<strong>Mission: Going Down</strong><br />
-As Xorlosh at the elevator for a 'mission'.<br />
-If you don't have gear wheels (lootable from worker/war golems) go to the sweaty cyclops in Ab.<br />
-Exchange three pieces of iron ore for gear wheels ('hi','gear wheel').<br />
-Deliver them to Xorlosh by saying 'mission' again.<br /><br /><br />

<strong>Mission: Justice for All</strong><br />
-Speak to Nokmir at the entrance to the northern mine.<br />
-Say 'hi', 'mission', 'ring', 'grombur', 'rerun', 'rehal'.<br />
-Go up the 3x stairs and Speak to emperor Rehal, 'hail emperor', 'nokmir', 'ring', 'rerun', 'promotion','grombur'.<br /> 
-Speak to Grombur at the entrance to the Southern mine, 'nokmir','ring','rerun','promotion'.<br />
-Enter the eastern mine (past the elevator), you need to have completed the 'Going Down' before.<br />
-Find the beer cask in the northwestern corner of the mine and rightclick the crystals right next to it.<br />
-You will find the ring, but unless it was a bug you won't see green text, so check your inventory and bp.<br />
-Bring the ring to the emperor, 'hail emperor', 'ring'...<br />
-Speak to Nokmir again, 'mission','acquitted'.<br /><br /><br />

<strong>Mission: Sweet as Chocolate Cake</strong><br />
-Ask Frafnar at the entrance to the western mine for a 'mission'.<br />
-Bake a chocolate cake if you don't have one. (use flour on milk, chocolate on dough, chocolate dough on oven).<br />
-Go up the 3x stairs in the main room, west halfway to the emperor and find the bar.<br />
-Speak to Bolfona, 'hi', 'chocolate cake', 'yes', 'Frafnar'.<br />
-Report back to Frafnar.<br /><br /><br />

<strong>Mission: The Good Guard</strong><br />
-Ask Grombur at the entrance to the southern mine for a 'mission'.<br />
-Go to Boozer in Venore and ask for 'dwarven brown ale'.<br />
-If you haven't done the Tibia Tales quest 'The perfect booze', you have to do it first ('mission').<br />
-Deliver the cask of ale to Grombur by saying 'mission'.<br /><br /><br />

<strong>Once done with all of these:</strong><br />
You can now speak to the dwarf NPC to the east, halfway to the emperor and buy rust remover to use on rusty armor/legs.<br />
With each mission you finish you also get access to the respective mine. Nothing much in there but dwarves, really.<br />
There is a 'Gold Ingot' in the eastern mine (past the elevator) and a 'Crystal of Focus' in the western mine.<br />
Both of them are found in skeletons or crates/boxes. I haven't found out what they are good for, maybe another quest.<br />
Oh, and there's 3 small topazs in a dead human in the northern mine.<br /><br />
