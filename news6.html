<h1>Independence.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Mar 30 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Got myself some new hosting now, plus a domain. Thanks to Najko who let me use his server for, well, a bit longer than planned. The new server grants me near infinite traffic and a couple of PHP extensions I didn't have on Najko's server so there's a slim chance I might continue on what I spoke of in the previous post. Obviously still being as lazy as I can be, so don't expect too much anytime soon.<br /><br />
What I do want to change though, is the site layout and scripting.<br />
It's shit - plus I feel bad whenever I go to blackD's site.<br />
Going to rewrite everything from scratch some time in April hopefully.<br /><br />
But yeh, let's see if this server is as fast and reliable as promised for a start.

<h1>Updatings.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Dec 01 2008</p>
<p class="newstxt">
So yeh, Christmas is near and there's lots of work to do.<br />
My little site has actually become somewhat popular so it's probably time for a personal stylesheet instead of this stolen patchwork shit thing (look at the source code of the top menu if you can read HTML/Javascript haha). And fixing the fully global meta tags. And switching to XHTML. Oh, and then there's my new hugeass project: A statistics site for Eternia only, combining Erig, Pskonejott and Tibiaring with even more different statistics in each of their respective areas, exp history and graphs for low-/midlevels also, MAYBE Tibiafreak.com's (edit: new domain owner made it a hacksite if I remember right) "who is pzlocked atm", basically a shitload of stuff to look at when you're bored. Reading through a million of articles atm to improve database and bandwidth usage so I can eventually put this up without having to pay 500ï¿½ a month for a hosting (hej Najko ;d).<br />
<strong>edit: Fuck it, found out we've got a 30gig traffic limit. Can't do much with that.</strong><br /><br />
Right now I'm playing <a href="http://www.l4d.com" target="_blank">Left4Dead</a> though. Awesome game.<br />
150k Eternia cash for a WORKING guide on how to play with people who bought it over Hamachi if you have the cracked nonSteam version only.<br />
Note the "WORKING", so fuck off with copypasting the first result from Google.

<h1>Najko is a Cock. And greedy.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Oct 10 2008</p>
<p class="newstxt">
As you probably noticed already, I put a couple of ads on both guild- and ventcheck. That's because Najko has to pay for the (dedicated) server himself now. I provide stuff you like/want/need - you view ads - he gets cash - I get free, reliable hosting.<br /><br />
Ventcheck has been moved from najko.com/ventrilo.php to flo.najko.com/vent/, and we'll do the same with the guildcheck page soonish (means, when Najko's back from his fjortis
parties (hi Pepe LOL)), for the simple reason that I don't have root access and he keeps fucking with the scripts which usually stops them from working. &lt;.&lt;<br />
tl;dr new guildcheck url will be flo.najko.com/guildcheck in 2-3 days.<br /><br />
Now for the saddest bit; I removed the dongs. Alliance members know why, lol.

Remember that one time when I said I'd update the site more often? I lied.<br /><br />
<strong>Small Problem with HotkeyChanger</strong><br />
Uploaded the wrong version here when I changed hosts, so if you downloaded it after I switched to najko.com, re-download and overwrite your files. With the flawed files your current configuration/hotkey set will be deleted when switching to a set that is already active. But yeh, going to make a newer, better and easier version within the next week anyway.<br /><br />
<strong>Careful when watching olders .cams</strong><br />
This is not a HKC-related problem but affects everybody. When watching a 8.11 or older cam with the new 2.0 TibiaCam.TV lite for Tibia 8.2 your config/hotkey set just gets erased<span class='red'>*</span>. Can't do much against it, but here's my solution<span class='red'>*</span> to it. Took about 30 seconds to make so don't expect it to be secure against YOU not following what I'm going to write now:<br /><br />
<strong>Instructions:</strong><br />
-run backup.bat<br />
-watch the old cam(s)<br />
-run restore.bat<br /><br />
Another way would be opening a Tibia client of version 8.2 or above, then watching the old cam(s) on an 8.0/8.1/8.11 <strong>MC</strong> client, closing the cam, then closing your real client because config is saved whenever you close a client.<br /><br />
<span class='red'>*</span><strong>edit, Aug 23rd:</strong> This is automatically detected and your config restored when using <a href="/tibia__hkc3.html">HKC3</a>. Nvm above solutions. Took the file down as well.

<h1>Site rehosted.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Jun 16 2008</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Quite pissed at my former hoster. I mean yeah, it is a free service - but 2 weeks of downtime with no response from the customer support? Great, thank you very much. Luckily not everybody on the internet is a complete fucktard, so Najko -whose name you might recall from hosting the guildcheck thingy- offered to rehost the entire site for some time.<br />Gracias Amigo.<br /><br />
Will probably (possibly) work the remaining sections over in the next few days, had no chance before as my host went down a day after the layout update.<br />
Ah well, off to bed, the past 3 days were pretty rough.

<h1>New Site launched.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Jun 14 2008</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Kay, fixed a couple of older sections and made a new CSS-based layout.<br />
Stole half of it from BD, but it probably took me longer to edit and fix than it took him to make it, and I just couldn't resist when I found out he used a colour scheme similar to my older ones. Feels kinda strange though, almost a bit too professional to actually be mine now, lol. Guess I have to customise it some more then.<br /><br />
Some of the old sections, like the Djinn/Rashid pricelist will stay down for now, as they were using custom stylesheets, and I really can't be arsed editing those now also. Will possibly do it by the weekend. Instead I added a new page to make accessing the newer war cams way easier by listing them all chronologically and by battle. You can find it <a href="cams__2008-alliance_vs_night_and_decessus.html">here</a>.<br /><br />
Cba writing more, I'm lazy you know. Will just put the site back up now, enjoy.
