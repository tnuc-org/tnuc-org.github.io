<h1>Hey&#178;.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Sep 23 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Complete site update coming soon, with a lot of new content and updates to older things including:<br />
-new layout<br />
-complete update of the cams sections for every war up until now<br />
-optional audio alert for ventcheck (as proposed by Blundcoder)<br />
-putting the unjusts thing on a separate page to make it faster, seeing it became somewhat popular after 8.5<br />
-releasing a new version of our wartool (script to manage chars, availability, phone numbers, and lots more)<br />
-complete rewrite of HKC3, adding new functionality and making it easier to get into<br /><br />
Will take some time though, and I'm not sure in how far I'll be able to stick to the schedule when uni starts next week.<br />
Haven't finished Prototype yet either, by the way.<br /><br />
On another note, I'm pretty much broke atm, so <strong>you'll get Mavina for only 100&euro;.</strong><br /><br />
Come on, do it.

<h1>Quick Update.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Jul 09 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Not really been in the mood for Tibia the past few days and the char is still up for sale, but since I've paid for at 
least another three months and I don't have much of a different use for the site, I might as well do what I've wanted 
to do for ages and update the cams of the previous wars (and the current one, of course). Unfortunately my memory 
is wank, so I made a thread on .com to catch up on all the things I forgot. 
Think you know anything about the older wars that might help me out?<br />
<a href="http://forum.tibia.com/forum/?action=thread&threadid=2681435" target="_blank">Go there</a> 
and post.<br />
Or just mail me from the site.<br /><br />
Btw1; Ventcheck updated and majorly bugfixed.<br />
Btw2; Fixed a <a href="/tibia__mc.html">7.6 MC</a>.
after the OT XXXXXs on vent annoyed me long enough.<br />
Btw3; I still have an updated guildcheck thingy for more than 1 guild laying around somewhere; will upload inabit.<br />
Btw4; WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SERVER SO FUCKING SLOW?<br />
Btw5; Kaisher's &quot;meter dick&quot; is still &quot;<a href="/tibia__vent_recordings.html">brilliant</a>&quot;.
<br /><br />
<strong>Update:</strong><br />
New war cams are up to date. Mail me if I'm missing any.

<h1>Fuck.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Jul 02 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
I've seen a lot of CIP fuckups over the years but this one's over the top.<br />
The 300+ pages of protest feel like a desperate attempt to keep an emo kid from cutting.<br /><br />
Mavina is up for sale now.<br />
115 ED, mlv somewhere around 68 after all my deaths. ^o)<br />
The account comes with a 56ED, a 47MS, a 58EK and LOTS of lv 10-30 chars.<br />
Deletion warning until December though.<br /><br />
Interested anyway? <a href="/contact.html">Mail me</a>.

<h1>New War II.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Jun 22 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
I blatantly lied when I said "tomorrow", but you should have known better.<br />
So yeh, we joined the war and frags went up to around 130-130 since.<br />
New cam section inabit, will try before the weekend but cba really.

<h1>New War.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Jun 15 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
It's only been two weeks since I deleted my Tibia desktop icon and started WoW over a lost bet.<br />
I'm not exactly sure what happened just yet but there's a massive clusterfuck going on on Eternia suddenly.<br />
Jynkky, Despiration and Ja Preziz leaders against Invisus, Loathe, Pinks, William McGregor's guild and that of Aondo?<br />
Over Jynkky/Despiration mass pking and slaughtering a PoI team?<br /><br />
Well whatever, it's entertaining at least. XXXXs fighting XXXXs - a win-win situation.<br />
The only way this could be more entertaining would be if people stopped messaging me about it urging me to join.<br /><br />
But yeh, I managed to fix some cams of our own last few actions.<br />
I'll put them up tomorrow  along with the few cams from the new chaos war thingy.<br /><br />
PS: <strike>You're all greedy XXXXs. Buy my druid for 500k Eternia cash, then. Maybe that works.</strike> <strong>SOLD</strong>.

<h1>Buy my Druid.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">May 21 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
No, not Mavina.<br />
I've got a 78ED on Askara that I once bought and never even prem'd afterwards. And I've got a looong list of shit I need to download. 
Get me a 3 months Rapidshare and a 3 months MegaUpload Premium and you'll get the char (regged on me, no criminal record, got new RK) for 
less than �40 (it's like �18 for Rapidshit and �20 for Megaupload).<br />
Do it.<br /><br />
As for NG, see my edit to the previous news post. Uploaded with a big "but".

<h1>New NG Crack.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">May 07 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
I just got my hands on a new NG crack.<br />
Will scan and test it, then update later.<br /><br />
<strong>Update May 8:</strong><br />The fuck, it's some weird older version. Need to check some more.<br /><br />
<strong>Update May 20:</strong><br />Been playing a random Korean MMO for a bit. Needless to say it was shit. Fuck Asia.<br />
As for the NG crack; it uses a cracked 2007 version of loader.exe, so the memory addresses for HP/Mana are non-functional. It has no support for 
potions and you can't run a healing script either. All in all you can't do shit with it, apart from botting low levels that won't need more 
healing than mana training / exura on full mana (which for whatever reason works while the scripter doesn't recognise Self.Mana). I had a 
few requests though, so I'll put it up now anyway.<br /><br />
I could probably try to fix something better but I can't really be bothered with Tibia just now, sorry.

<h1>Developer Notes.</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Apr 26 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
More like, developer wank.<br />
Lacks the witty rhyme, but it's a fact nonetheless.<br /><br />
<pre>D - Mav / Flo: cock
S - Lucid: u
D - Mav / Flo: give me a rude word that rhymes with notes
S - Lucid: scrotes (lol made up short version of plural for scrotum)
D - Mav / Flo: I genuinely hate you
<span class="red">*** User has disconnected ***</span></pre><br />
Instant deaths and black skulls that won't let you attack unskulled chars as replacement for pking bans, cities becoming Non-PVP zones, and that's only the beginning. I'm not really sure what CIP were thinking when they decided to post about their completely retarded ideas beforehand, giving us the chance to post 50 pages of "NO, FUCK THAT!", all of which will just be ignored in the end. They must have pictured it as some kind metaphorical window into their heads while in fact said window is covered with a huge shit stain so you can't see inside - for the better I suppose.<br /><br />
There's not much in and around Tibia that makes me want to punch the nearest wall in real life, but my top 3 would be Mekila's voice on Vent, CIP's developer notes and the fact that I am incapable of replying to either of them without giving in to the urge to spam "OH FUCK OFF" all over the place. If you think you can do it, take a look at the <a href="http://forum.tibia.com/forum/?action=thread&threadid=2582930" target="_blank">Non-PVP zones on PVP worlds</a> and <a href="http://forum.tibia.com/forum/?action=thread&threadid=2582942" target="_blank">black skull</a> threads on Tibia.com.<br /><br />
On another (developer) note, I took some time and finished that <a href="http://unjusts.tnuc.org">red skull/unjusts counter</a> thingy I was speaking of the other day. It doesn't only tell you when you lose your red skull, but also how many unjusts you can take without getting/renewing RS or taking ban and some more statistics stuff. I'll put it up in the nav bar on the left while I don't have the new NG/Elf cracks for 8.42 yet. My providers are being slow. &lt;.&lt;<br /><br />
<strong>Fun fact:</strong><br />
I noticed, by coincidence, that ND use my vent script to check OUR vent and forwarded them to meatspin.com instead.<br />
Enjoy your dick helicopter.

<h1>Ahead of Schedule!?</h1>
<p class="mnewsdate">Apr 17 2009</p>
<p class="newstxt">
Here we go, new layout's done. Or well, it's meant to be a rough sketch of the final thing only, but I believe we all know I cba.<br /><br />
Anyway, menu animation won't stay like it is. It was more of a tech test. Banner probably will, I suck at making those.<br />
Thought I'd get rid of the French name prefix though. Nobody likes France...<br /><br />
Future plans? I'm rather busy at the moment, real life is kicking in (fuck you Rammsy) and the instant I log on vent people just won't leave me alone until I log off again. 
But as said, the first thing I'll do will we writing the guildcheck and ventcheck scripts from scratch and adding some more features to ventcheck. They date back to the 
time when I'd just started with PHP and are <strong>really</strong> badly scripted. There's this typo on ventcheck even that makes it show a semicolon in the top left 
corner. Been there from the first upload, ultimate proof of my cba-ness if you ask me. Next, I'll sort my cams from the older Eternia wars and upload them accordingly. 
Shouldn't take too long, the usual DL-style war ended 30-15 to &lt;name of PA guild&gt; after 3 months of war, lol. Makes me appreciate how fast-paced the past year has 
been, really. And we keep getting faster - quoting Rewonn, "soon, very soon" we'll be as badass as Titania, Aurea and Thoria. Maybe.<br /><br />
Another thing I could really need would be a proper unjusts aka "MAN WHEN I LOSE RS? ;;" calculator. Pskonejott isn't much of a help there, and you'd be surprised how many 
people seem to be unable to grasp the "1/d,5/w,10/m" concept and have me count for them instead. If CIP still hasn't implemented anything about hotkeys by the summer 
update, I'll make HKC4 and add some more features like better OT compatibility and more customization as to what information to handle globally (for all hotkey sets) 
and what not to.<br /><br />
Anything bigger than that (previous posts) will have to wait a while, as -if anything- I'll integrate a newer version of our war script right into it to avoid load waste. 
Was thinking of rewriting it from zero again already anyway after I pretty much got myself into a dead end scripting-wise and it's just not worth the effort upgrading 
it the way it is atm - or no fun anymore at least.<br /><br />
Five days until the new privacy policy comes into effect by the way. I've uninstalled my NG already. They say they won't make use of it in their Jihad on botting, but come 
on... when has CIP been honest with us? It's clear that their magic oh so automatic system does not just ban everybody but instead compiles a list 5000 from which are banned once a month, but I for one don't want my deletion warned main account on that list for making some cash on secondaries. Luckily the 21st century has not only given us millions of prepubescent fuckwads acting tough on the internet but also the software to get around CIP's excuse for spyware. As said, I've uninstalled NG and instead bot on a virtual machine now only. Obviously, a laptop or 2nd comp would make it a lot easier, but hey, I'm poor. I'll write some more on this in a few days if you're interested, but enough for now.<br /><br />
Enjoy the new site.
